Topic: The Wolf of Wall Street

In this game, the player plays as a stockbroker. Initially a certain amount of money will be paid to the player's account. In the stock market, the player can make decisions to buy or sell stocks. The share price floats in a moderate range. Additionally, some events will happen to affect the share price to a large extent. For example, since the steady growth of China-US relations, oil shares moves up. This kind of principle requires the player to observe the trend of this model stock market. With the rise of player's money, more and more advanced stocks and props will unlock. The way to win this game is to earn the target money.

1.     Random number generator is used to <1> determine the floating of stock price <2> control for the release of different news.
2.     Multiple 1D arrays and 2D arrays will be used to store sets of incidents/news as well as collections of different commodities to be traded in the market. 
3.     Dynamic memory management will be in need since we will use containers like vectors to store the player’s and the stockmarket's condition.
4.     Standard I/O will also be important to receive player’s action and conserve the game status whenever the game is terminated/rebooted.
5.     At last, multiple functions will be put in different files to ensure function reusability.
6.     etc…
